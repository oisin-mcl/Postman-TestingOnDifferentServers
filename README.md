# Postman-Testing On Different Servers

This short collection works as a basic framework that allows us to test our code against different build servers. The use case for this is for companies that use differnet build servers that require testing. For this collection, I have used 3 different servers; "SandBox", "Test" and "Production". This uses the Postman Environment features to achive and will allow code to be as DRY as possible without the need to duplicate your code or tests across each test server you wish to use.
